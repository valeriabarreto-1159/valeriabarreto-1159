## Hi there ðŸŒ»
I am a project manager and scrum enthusiast. I have been on several software teams over the years and have always been curious to dive a little deeper into the tech side, so here I am finally getting my fingers in some light things! I am looking forward to learning, failing, and hopefully succeeding too.
